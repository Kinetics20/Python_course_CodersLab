    <p>Having the Eubank Jr-Benn fight scheduled on the same night will hurt the PPV numbers for Fury vs. Usyk in the UK, but probably not in the U.S. American boxing fans don</p>
    <p>Deontay Wilder was the only real talent that Fury has faced, and he was arguably knocked out in the first and third fights against him. Wladimir Klitschko was 40 years old when Fury fought him and entirely over the hill.</p>
    <p>The boxing public will still be interested in seeing the Fury-Usyk fight, even if Fury is coming off a loss to Ngannou</p>
